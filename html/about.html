        <p>
            My journey into tech started with my enlistment in the Air National Guard as a Radio Technician. 
            Since then, I have been pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at Oakland University.
            The Air National Guard has taught me the importance of team work, comradery and resilience. And
            Oakland University has taught me the fundamental knowledge of how computers work and interact with each other. 
            I am very thankful for all that I have experienced, and am ready to apply everything I have learned to the civilian sector.
